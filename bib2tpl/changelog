  * Added Spanish (es) language file.
  * Change e2mn method in helper.inc.php to use the month name in the
    languge file as a pattern. This way, month sorting can be done correctly
    when e.g. month names are in English but output language is Spanish, or
    when months in the bibtex use abreviations; if the language file includes
    months defininitons like:
        '01' => 'enero|ene|january|jan'
  * Language files (en, de, es) updated to add month names alternatives
    through patterns: short forms and English alternatives.
