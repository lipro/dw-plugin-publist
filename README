publist Plugin for DokuWiki

Includes the content of BibTeX files in DokuWiki pages in a flexible way.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:publist

Additionally, use parameter author:page:authorpage if you want links to
websites of coauthors added automatically to the bibtex entries. The
specified authorpage page or file requires author URLs followed by their
names (as they appear fully formatted), and will automatically replace
Author Name with [[Author_URL|Author Name]]

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/publist/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!
